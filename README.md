### Expense tracker made with Java SwingFX using MVC architecture
---
## Steps to Run

### Compilation
Compile all at once from directory above src
```sh
javac src/*.java
```
Or compile all individually within the src directory
```sh
javac Model.java View.java Controller.java ExpenseTracker.java
```

### Running
```sh
java ExpenseTracker
```

## Jar File (Optional)
I wanted to create a jar file because I wanted to access this from my desktop and use it easily. I used eclipse, but there are many other ways to make JAR files.
Make sure everything is compiled and works correctly before making jar file.
